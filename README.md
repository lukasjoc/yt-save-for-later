# yt-save-for-later
> Saves the state of any youtube video and brings you back to the video where your left off

## Info:
- Learn how to create chrome/chromium extensions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)	

##  How this works:
- Searches for current value in ```.ytp-time-current```
- saves video in this format for later ```protocol:youtube_url:video_id:timestamp```
- then if you click on the video in your saved feed of vieos it will bring you to the timestamp your left off
- easy UI. doesn't look great but PR's welcome to fix that. maybe google material design?
